# Image Enhancement for Color Vision Deficiency based on Empirical Color Naming Simulation

## Background  
CVD (Color Vision Deficiency) can cause significant challenges in visual communication and interaction, as it can make it difficult for individuals with CVD to distinguish between colors and follow color instructions. While existing CVD color filter algorithms address the seperation of color components for CVD (e.g. color filter in iOS and Android for accessibility), our color filter also make the color namable for CVD. In this case, CVD can distinguish and identify the color correctly. 

## TODO List

-[] 1. Filter Model    
-[] 2. Degradation Model (CVD simulator with torch framework)    
-[] 3. DIY SFT Trainer (Train on color words only)    
-[] 4. Pipeline (Join models, and Training script)
